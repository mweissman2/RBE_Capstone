# keywords: primitive/geometry
# Box with customizable texture mapping on selected faces.
# If the boolean value associated with a face (`frontFace`, `leftFace`, etc.) is FALSE, then the uniform color specified in `faceColor` field will be applied instead of the texture.
# This is an extension of the TexturedBox geometry PROTO.
# Available texture mappings:
# - `cube` mapping: see texture at projects/samples/geometries/worlds/textures/cube_mapping.jpg
# - `compact` cube mapping: see texture at projects/samples/geometries/worlds/textures/compact_mapping.jpg
# - `flat` mapping: projecting the texture on the front face.
# - `metric` mapping: similar to default mapping but the texture is not deformed to match each face size.
# - `default` mapping: same texture on all the faces.
#
# A demo of these mappings is available in projects/samples/geometries/worlds/textured_boxes.wbt.
# template language: javascript
